I called them, they picked up on the first ring, set a time to come by, and even showed up early, but of course called ahead. Very reliable and great customer service. Wish i broke my phone more often, as these guys run a solid service, and would recommend them to anyone.","name":"jay c.","avatar":"http:\/\/s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com\/photo\/zc9t1Ml43YKPw0lqi4XNeQ\/ms.jpg","city":"San Diego, CA"}]
