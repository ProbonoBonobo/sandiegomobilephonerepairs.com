We need our phone repaired today, and he is able to accommodate and fit us in! Once we meet up, with Jacob, he&#39;s amazing! He is friendly, professional, and fast! He did an amazing job repairing our phone!! So if you find yourself in a pinch like us, Jacob is the guy to contact!!  Thank you, Jacob!! Hopefully I don&#39;t need my iPhone 7 or 7s repair in the future!  :)",

I tell him, cmon bro, I can&#39;t be out here looking reckless. can you fit me in tonight? now I&#39;m in del mar, & he says if you can meet me in santee at 8, I got you. ok. bet. head down to santee at this little Starbucks. side note. there was a guy in there on his laptop play WOW, & talking to his bros. thought that was funny. anyways, here&#39;s my man Jake sitting, looking like Morpheus from the matrix. lol. tools and parts, ready to go. this guy is a wizard. screws stick to the screw driver via magnets, & he&#39;s doing this screen replacement like a one man nascar pit crew. 730 screen is cracked. 830 phone looks like new. not to mention, he threw on a screen protector for free as well. oh, and my friend, her screen is cracked too, she opted not to get it fixed tonight. Jake really cares, & put on a screen protector on her phone as well, for free, to prevent further damage. now if that&#39;s not good service, idk what is. I don&#39;t plan on breaking my phone anytime soon, again, but I will deff be sending any one and everyone I know who needs repair, his way.",

Thanks to the &#34;Request quote&#34; feature , I was able to fan out a quote request to multiple vendors. The first response that I got , within a minute , was from Jacob. And none of the others were able to beat the price quoted by JacobThe fact that they offer a mobile repair service was an added bonus considering our unpredictable schedules. Set up an appointment for next day at my workplace. Jacob and Devin showed up a bit earlier in fact They were extremely professional , knowledgable ,got down to work without wasting a second. And replaced the broken screen in a jiffy. Also offered a tempered glass protector for a discount. The phone looked neat and new but I noticed some lines showing up when the screen was black. I just called them again to check if anything was wrong. They absolutely didn&#39;t mind coming back and checked once again. I really appreciate the honesty of these guys for I&#39;m sure 9/10 times I would have gotten a response that it was an existing fault with the phone if I had gone else where to fix the screen. Jacob did admit it was a problem with the screen(albeit the first instance for a 6 plus screen )and instantly replaced with another one without any issuesOn the whole it was a smooth process and would definitely seek out these guys if anything untoward happens to our phones  in the future",
